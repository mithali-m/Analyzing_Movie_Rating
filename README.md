# Analyzing_Movie_Rating
Involves analyzing a movie rating dataset with Apache Spark to compute mean and standard deviation for each movie, ensuring accuracy through testing.

1. Configure with Spark 3.2.1 and Scala 2.12.x by updating build.sbt with necessary dependencies
2. Load the movie ratings dataset from a CSV file into a Spark DataFrame using Spark's DataFrame API
3. Write the calculateStats method to compute the mean and standard deviation of ratings for each movie
4. Develop unit tests using ScalaTest to validate the implementation against various scenarios
5. Run the program to process the dataset and generate the computed statistics for all movies.
